                    Do you observe a need for synchronization techniques on any of the threads in practise, or does your program work by accident?

                    Regardless of whether you observe the problem on your machine, we need to handle it.
                    What is the problem I’m hinting at, and how can we solve it? (Since I’m such a nice guy, here’s a hint: think about the VolatileExample class from the demo today).

        <h2>Exercise 2</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Are you able to provoke the expected error on your machine?
                </p>
                <p>
                    -ANSWER: No I am not. I have tried to run it more than 20 times without errors. Then I tried to create 4 threads and then run it, but still with no errors.
                </p>

            <li>

                    How often does the problem occur?
                </p>
                <p>
                    -ANSWER: Never. Nomatter how many times I run it it will only make even numbers.

                    Use the synchronization techniques you’ve learned today, to make next() method atomic with respect to itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -ANSWER: Despite that I couldn't make it to fail I have surrounded the method synchronized, but it is hard to see if it make a different since it was working the whole time.

                    I know that the method in the Even-class works perfectly and only prints out even numbers.
                    I know my ThreadClass is right and call the next()-method from the Even-class.
                    I have created 4 threads in the Main-class that all are using the constructor in the ThreadClass.
                    I know my solution is correct because our clever teacher Sigurd has checked it.
